abstract = {Collecting massive commonsense knowledge (CSK) for commonsense reasoning has been a long time standing challenge within artificial intelligence research. Numerous methods and systems for acquiring CSK have been developed to overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Although some specific commonsense reasoning tasks have been presented to allow researchers to measure and compare the performance of their CSK systems, we compare them at a higher level from the following aspects: CSK acquisition task (what CSK is acquired from where), technique used (how can CSK be acquired), and CSK evaluation methods (how to evaluate the acquired CSK). In this survey, we first present a categorization of CSK acquisition systems and the great challenges in the field. Then, we review and compare the CSK acquisition systems in detail. Finally, we conclude the current progress in this field and explore some promising future research issues.},
annote = {Good survey for related work. Main conclusions:

- Mostly measuring correctness of the kwnowledge and efficiency of collecting. Missing good evaluation methiods.

@article{Mitchell2015,
abstract = {Whereas people learn many different types of knowledge from diverse experiences over many years, most current ma- chine learning systems acquire just a single function or data model from just a single data set. We propose a never- ending learning paradigm for machine learning, to better re- flect the more ambitious and encompassing type of learn- ing performed by humans. As a case study, we describe the Never-Ending Language Learner (NELL), which achieves some of the desired properties of a never-ending learner, and we discuss lessons learned. NELL has been learning to read the web 24 hours/day since January 2010, and so far has ac- quired a knowledge base with over 80 million confidence- weighted beliefs (e.g., servedWith(tea, biscuits)). NELL has also learned millions of features and parameters that enable it to read these beliefs from the web. Additionally, it has learned to reason over these beliefs to infer new beliefs, and is able to extend its ontology by synthesizing new relational predi- cates. NELL can be tracked online at http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu, and followed on Twitter at @CMUNELL. Introduction},

abstract = {We are interested in the problem of reasoning over very large common sense knowledge bases. When such a knowledge base contains noisy and subjective data, it is important to have a method for making rough conclusions based on simi- larities and tendencies, rather than absolute truth. We present AnalogySpace, which accomplishes this by forming the ana- logical closure of a semantic network through dimensionality reduction. It self-organizes concepts around dimensions that can be seen as making distinctions such as “good vs. bad” or “easy vs. hard”, and generalizes its knowledge by judging where concepts lie along these dimensions. An evaluation demonstrates that users often agree with the predicted knowl- edge, and that its accuracy is an improvement over previous techniques. Introduction},

In addition to being interactive and entertaining, our interface guides the knowledge acquisition process to learn about the most salient characteristics of a particular concept. We use statistical classification methods to discover the most informative characteristics in the Open Mind Common Sense knowledge base, and use these characteristics to play a game of 20 Questions with the user. Our interface also allows users to enter knowledge more quickly than a more traditional knowledge-acquisition interface. An evaluation showed that users enjoyed the game and that it increased the speed of knowledge acquisition.},

abstract = {Abstract. Open Mind Common Sense is a knowledge acquisition system de- signed to acquire commonsense knowledge from the general public over the web. We describe and evaluate our first fielded system, which enabled the construction of a 450,000 assertion commonsense knowledge base. We then discuss how our second-generation system addresses weaknesses discovered in the first. The new system acquires facts, descriptions, and stories by allowing participants to construct and fill in natural language templates. It employs word-sense disambiguation and methods of clarifying entered knowledge, ana- logical inference to provide feedback, and allows participants to validate knowledge and in turn each other.},
