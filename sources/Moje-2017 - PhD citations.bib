abstract = {Machine learning about language can be improved by supplying it with specific knowledge and sources of external information. We present here a new version of the linked open data resource ConceptNet that is particularly well suited to be used with modern NLP techniques such as word embeddings. ConceptNet is a knowledge graph that connects words and phrases of natural language with labeled edges. Its knowledge is collected from many sources that include expert-created resources, crowd-sourcing, and games with a purpose. It is designed to represent the general knowledge involved in understanding language, improving natural language applications by allowing the application to better understand the meanings behind the words people use. When ConceptNet is combined with word embeddings acquired from distributional semantics (such as word2vec), it provides applications with understanding that they would not acquire from distributional semantics alone, nor from narrower resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. We demonstrate this with state-of-the-art results on intrinsic evaluations of word relatedness that translate into improvements on applications of word vectors, including solving SAT-style analogies.},

abstract = {Games with A Purpose have successfully harvested information from web users. However, designing games that encourage sustainable and quality data contribution remains a great challenge. Given that many online communities have enjoyed active participation from a loyal following, this research explores how human computation games may benefit from rich interactions inherent in a community. We experimented by implementing two games for commonsense data collection on the leading social community platforms: the Rapport Game on Facebook and the Virtual Pet Game on PTT. In this paper, we present the choices of interaction mode and goal-oriented user model for building a community-based game. The data quality, collection efficiency, player retention, concept diversity, and game stability of both games are analyzed quantitatively from data collected since August/November 2008. Our findings should provide useful suggestions for designing community-based games in the future.},

abstract = {Collecting massive commonsense knowledge (CSK) for commonsense reasoning has been a long time standing challenge within artificial intelligence research. Numerous methods and systems for acquiring CSK have been developed to overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Although some specific commonsense reasoning tasks have been presented to allow researchers to measure and compare the performance of their CSK systems, we compare them at a higher level from the following aspects: CSK acquisition task (what CSK is acquired from where), technique used (how can CSK be acquired), and CSK evaluation methods (how to evaluate the acquired CSK). In this survey, we first present a categorization of CSK acquisition systems and the great challenges in the field. Then, we review and compare the CSK acquisition systems in detail. Finally, we conclude the current progress in this field and explore some promising future research issues.},

The KRAKEN system is designed to allow subject-matter experts to make meaningful additions to an existing knowledge base, without the benefit of training in the areas of artificial intelligence, ontology development, or logical representation. Users interact with KRAKEN via a natural-language interface, which translates back and forth between English and the KB's logical representation language. A variety of specialized tools are available to guide users through the process of creating new concepts, stating facts about those concepts, and querying the knowledge base. KRAKEN has undergone two independent performance evaluations. In this paper we describe the general structure and several of the features of KRAKEN, focussing on key aspects of its functionality in light of the specific knowledge-formation and acquisition challenges they are intended to address.},

abstract = {We are interested in the problem of reasoning over very large common sense knowledge bases. When such a knowledge base contains noisy and subjective data, it is important to have a method for making rough conclusions based on simi- larities and tendencies, rather than absolute truth. We present AnalogySpace, which accomplishes this by forming the ana- logical closure of a semantic network through dimensionality reduction. It self-organizes concepts around dimensions that can be seen as making distinctions such as “good vs. bad” or “easy vs. hard”, and generalizes its knowledge by judging where concepts lie along these dimensions. An evaluation demonstrates that users often agree with the predicted knowl- edge, and that its accuracy is an improvement over previous techniques. Introduction},

abstract = {Whereas people learn many different types of knowledge from diverse experiences over many years, most current ma- chine learning systems acquire just a single function or data model from just a single data set. We propose a never- ending learning paradigm for machine learning, to better re- flect the more ambitious and encompassing type of learn- ing performed by humans. As a case study, we describe the Never-Ending Language Learner (NELL), which achieves some of the desired properties of a never-ending learner, and we discuss lessons learned. NELL has been learning to read the web 24 hours/day since January 2010, and so far has ac- quired a knowledge base with over 80 million confidence- weighted beliefs (e.g., servedWith(tea, biscuits)). NELL has also learned millions of features and parameters that enable it to read these beliefs from the web. Additionally, it has learned to reason over these beliefs to infer new beliefs, and is able to extend its ontology by synthesizing new relational predi- cates. NELL can be tracked online at http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu, and followed on Twitter at @CMUNELL. Introduction},

We describe and evaluate our first fielded system, which enabled the construction of a 450,000 assertion commonsense knowledge base. We then discuss how our second-generation system addresses weaknesses discovered in the first. The new system acquires facts, descriptions, and stories by allowing participants to construct and fill in natural language templates. It employs word-sense disambiguation and methods of clarifying entered knowledge, ana- logical inference to provide feedback, and allows participants to validate knowledge and in turn each other.},
