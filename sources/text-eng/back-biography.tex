The author of this thesis is PhD candidate from Artificial Intelligence Lab at 
Jozef Stefan Institute, Slovenia. His research interests and PhD topic are in 
Natural Language Processing, Logical Inference, Knowledge Extraction and
Crowdsourcing. In 2010 he graduated from Faculty of Electrical Engineering and
started his doctoral studies at Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School.
He worked as an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning researcher at
Jožef Stefan Artificial Intelligence Laboratory since 2005 on the topics related
to this thesis. From 2008 to 2013 he also worked as a principal software 
engineer for Cycorp Europe, which was at the time an EU branch of the American 
AI company Cyc Inc. During these years, he worked on an EU project developing 
distributed large scale inference engine (LarKC), and also on an AI assistant 
build on top of Cyc which lead to the development and implementation of the
approach described in this thesis. Some of the recent projects with a similar
topic include a concept of an intelligent motorhome (reasoning engine software 
interacting with sensors and actuators) for a European motorhome producer 
(Adria Mobil) and Named Entity Disambiguation algorithm which is a work in 
progress in a collaboration with US Company Bloomberg L.P.
