\emph{OIE (Open Information Extraction} is a paradigm introduced by Oren Etizoni in his TextRunner system. THe main idea of this paradigm is that the knowledge acquisition system is not pre-determined to extract some specific facts, patterns, etc, but is open-ended, extracting large set of relational tuples without any human input.\\
\emph{PMI (Pointwise Mutual Information} is a measure which captures 
co-occurence relationsip between terms in a big corpus.\\
